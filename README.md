## My process

I start with mind mapping the layout of the site; what containers, flex or grid, divs required, classes needed. Once I have a good idea on how to tackle the project, I start writing the HTML using VSCode with Live Server or Preview so that I can see the progess as I go along. After all the content is done, I continue the process for the CSS styling. I try not to look at other people's challenge code for answers if I have a hang up, but instead google search what I am trying to accomplish. This method has helped me improve my skill and knowledge. After all is done and I am pleased with my results, I add everything here ðŸ˜€.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I am fairly new to web development so this was a nice project to help me increase my comfort with flexbox.

### Continued development

I work with software developers so I see a lot of front end code. I am working towards mastering CSS and moving into learning more JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to CSS Flex](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - CSS-TRICK's comprehensive guide to CSS flexbox layout. Very useful tool!

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - If you are not using this resource, you need to start. Useful for everything!
